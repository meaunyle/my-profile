   <p class="margin-bottom">I am currently in my final year at Audencia Bachelor in management, specialising in international development, and I am lucky enough to be able to take all my classes in English. During my studies, I have been able to develop my knowledge of international trade and increase my skills through multi-faceted internships where I have been able to demonstrate rigour and commitment.
   I am specialised in imports, but I would like to continue to expand my knowledge on many subjects. I am very curious by nature and have a thirst for knowledge, so I want to be able to touch everything! Among the courses at Audencia, some stood out:</p>
